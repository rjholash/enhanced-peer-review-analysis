**Reliability Score: 75-100**

**Consistency & Agreement (4 points)**
- Reviews demonstrate high consistency with peer consensus
- Ratings align well with group mean assessments
- Shows understanding of evaluation criteria
- Minimal deviation from established standards

**Time Investment & Thoroughness (3 points)**
- Adequate time spent on each review (>2 minutes total)
- Evidence of careful consideration
- Thoughtful engagement with material
- Reviews reflect substantial effort

**Assessment Quality (2-3 points)**
- Balanced and fair evaluations
- Minimal severity or leniency bias
- Appropriate use of rating scale range
- Objective assessment approach

**Additional Indicators:**
- Reviews contribute positively to group score reliability
- High inter-rater reliability contribution
- Professional and constructive feedback

---

### **Good (8 points)**
**Reliability Score: 65-74**

**Consistency & Agreement (3 points)**
- Generally consistent with peer consensus
- Most ratings align with group assessments
- Good understanding of criteria with minor gaps
- Some deviation but within acceptable range

**Time Investment & Thoroughness (2-3 points)**
- Reasonable time investment (1-2 minutes total)
- Shows consideration of material
- Adequate engagement level
- Reviews demonstrate effort

**Assessment Quality (2 points)**
- Mostly balanced evaluations
- Minor bias toward leniency or severity
- Good use of rating scale
- Generally objective approach

**Additional Indicators:**
- Reviews contribute to group reliability
- Moderate inter-rater reliability
- Constructive feedback approach

---

### **Satisfactory (7 points)**
**Reliability Score: 55-64**

**Consistency & Agreement (2-3 points)**
- Moderate consistency with peers
- Some alignment with group consensus
- Basic understanding of criteria
- Noticeable deviation from group norms

**Time Investment & Thoroughness (2 points)**
- Minimal adequate time investment
- Shows basic engagement
- Limited evidence of deep consideration
- Meets minimum requirements

**Assessment Quality (2 points)**
- Somewhat balanced evaluations
- Noticeable bias patterns
- Limited use of rating scale range
- Some subjectivity in assessments

**Additional Indicators:**
- Neutral impact on group reliability
- Variable inter-rater consistency
- Basic feedback quality

---

### **Needs Improvement (5-6 points)**
**Reliability Score: 35-54**

**Consistency & Agreement (1-2 points)**
- Poor consistency with peer consensus
- Significant deviation from group norms
- Limited understanding of criteria
- Ratings often inconsistent with standards

**Time Investment & Thoroughness (1-2 points)**
- Insufficient time investment (<1 minute total)
- Limited engagement with material
- Evidence of rushed assessment
- Below minimum effort threshold

**Assessment Quality (1-2 points)**
- Unbalanced evaluations
- Strong bias toward extremes (too high/low)
- Poor use of rating scale
- Subjective or inappropriate assessments

**Additional Indicators:**
- Negative impact on group score reliability
- Low inter-rater consistency
- May require additional training

**Special Considerations:**
- Reviews receive reduced weight in group calculations
- May indicate misunderstanding of assessment criteria
- Potential bias toward friends or personal preferences

---

### **Poor (3-4 points)**
**Reliability Score: <35**

**Consistency & Agreement (0-1 points)**
- Very poor consistency with peers
- Major deviation from all group norms
- Minimal understanding of criteria
- Ratings contradict established patterns

**Time Investment & Thoroughness (0-1 points)**
- Extremely insufficient time (<30 seconds total)
- No evidence of meaningful engagement
- Rushed or superficial assessment
- Well below acceptable standards

**Assessment Quality (0-2 points)**
- Highly unbalanced evaluations
- Extreme bias in ratings
- Inappropriate use of scale
- Non-objective assessments

**Additional Indicators:**
- Significantly negative impact on group reliability
- Very low inter-rater agreement
- Reviews excluded from group calculations
- Requires immediate intervention

---

## **Special Circumstances & Appeals**

### **Time Penalty Adjustments**
- Reviews completed in <1 minute total time automatically receive 3-point penalty
- Minimum possible score with time penalty: 3/10
- Students may appeal if technical issues affected timing

### **Bias Considerations**
- **Leniency Bias**: Consistently rating higher than peers may indicate friendship bias
- **Severity Bias**: Consistently rating lower may indicate overly high standards
- **Appeal Process**: Students scoring <6.5/10 may request instructor review

### **Statistical Reliability Factors**
- **Group Size**: Minimum 2 reviewers required for reliability calculations
- **Missing Data**: Students with insufficient data receive default score of 7/10
- **Cronbach's Alpha**: Group consistency affects individual score interpretation

## **Rubric Application Guidelines**

### **For Instructors:**
1. **Automated Scoring**: System calculates scores based on statistical analysis
2. **Manual Override**: Instructor may adjust for extenuating circumstances
3. **Appeals Process**: Clear pathway for students to contest assessments
4. **Transparency**: Students see their reliability metrics and explanations

### **For Students:**
1. **Clear Expectations**: Understand that quality is measured statistically
2. **Time Investment**: Minimum time thresholds for meaningful assessment
3. **Consistency**: Alignment with peer consensus indicates understanding
4. **Fairness**: Avoid extreme bias toward friends or against competitors
